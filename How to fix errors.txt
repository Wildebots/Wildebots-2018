If vscode asks for JDK, go into settings, search java.home, select edit and change value of java.home to the path of your JDK.
Then, go to file exporer, right-click "My PC", select properties then environment variables and add variable JAVA_HOME with 
the path as your value. Also, add the path to PATH variable.

If vscode cannot find the JDK version, update gradle to support the JDK that you are using.

If vscode cannot find gradleRIO, then download gradle language support from Naco Siren
